# üîç Code Search and Analysis System  using Mutli-hop Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for Strato Mercata

A semantic code search and analysis tool that indexes your codebase using embeddings and stores it in **Weaviate**, enabling **LLM-powered queries** over both code and documentation.

What is RAG?

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that uses a large language model (LLM) to generate text based on a given prompt. It is a type of generative AI that uses a large language model to generate text based on a given prompt.   

What is Multi-hop RAG?

Multi-hop RAG is a technique that uses a large language model (LLM) to generate text based on a given prompt. THe LLM interacts with a vector DB askign for increasingly more context as needed.

How does it work?

The LLM is given a prompt and a vector DB. It then uses the prompt to search the vector DB for relevant context. It then uses the context to generate a response.

Note: Currently ASTs for edges are not done. This would make queries even more accurate.

## üß∞ Tech Stack

- **Weaviate**: Vector database for semantic search  
- **OpenAI**: Embedding generation & LLM reasoning  
- **Python**: Backend for indexing, querying, and serving APIs  
- **Docker + Docker Compose**: Containerized infrastructure  
- **Flask**: Lightweight API server  
- **Node.js + NVM**: Frontend interface for search and visualization  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+  
- Docker + Docker Compose  
- `venv` (or any Python virtual environment tool)  
- Node.js 21 (via NVM) for the frontend  

---

## üì¶ Installation

### üîÅ Clone the repository (including submodules for repo)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/davidnallapu/mercata-multi-hop-rag-llm.git
cd mercata-multi-hop-rag-llm
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

---

## üß† Indexing the Codebase

### 1. Set up Python backend

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or `.venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Start Weaviate vector DB

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

> Weaviate will be started with the `text2vec-transformers` vectorizer plugin.

### 3. Run the code indexer

This project uses the `gpt-4-turbo` OpenAI model, so please ensure that your API keys have access to that model.

Make sure you have the correct OpenAI API key in your `.env` file or global environment:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

```bash
python embed_codebase_weaviate.py
```

This will:
- üßπ Clean existing data  
- üèóÔ∏è Initialize schema  
- üßæ Parse code using Tree-sitter  
- üîó Extract call graphs and definitions  
- üìö Process documentation (e.g. Markdown, docx)  
- üì° Upload everything to Weaviate  

---

## üåê Starting the Search Backend (API)

```bash
python query_codebase_weaviate2.py
```

> Exposes an API at `http://localhost:5000`.

---

## üíª Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
nvm use 21
npm run dev
```

> This will launch the frontend at `http://localhost:3000` (or specified port).

---

## üì° API Capabilities

Once the backend is running:
- Search function and variable definitions semantically  
- Ask: ‚ÄúWhere is function X used?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat calls Y?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat does Z mean?‚Äù  
- Retrieve and cross-link code, docs, and relationships  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### üîß Weaviate Settings

Modify:
- `docker-compose.yml` for container settings  
- Class schema, vectorizer, and module options  


### üß† Model Configs

Tweak inside `query_codebase_weaviate2.py` or `embed_codebase_weaviate.py`

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### üîç Weaviate Issues

```bash
docker ps                        # ensure containers are up
docker logs mercata-llm3_weaviate_1
```

- Check `.env` for valid OpenAI key  
- Ensure vector modules are enabled in Docker Compose  

### üß© Indexing Issues

- Tree-sitter must be installed and working  
- Watch logs for parser or schema errors
